# Token Parsing Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing a `Token parse error: InvalidCharacterError: Failed to execute 'atob' on 'Window': The string to be decoded is not correctly encoded` error. This was happening because:

1. Corrupted or malformed JWT tokens were stored in localStorage
2. The `atob()` function was failing when trying to decode invalid base64 strings
3. Poor error handling was not gracefully managing these edge cases

## Root Cause
The original token parsing logic in `ProtectedRoute.jsx` was:
- Not validating token format before attempting to decode
- Not handling base64 decoding errors properly
- Not clearing corrupted tokens from localStorage consistently

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Token Validation (`src/utils.js`)
Added comprehensive utility functions:
- `isValidTokenFormat()` - Validates JWT structure (3 parts separated by dots)
- `parseJWTPayload()` - Safely parses JWT payload with proper error handling
- `isTokenExpired()` - Checks token expiration
- `clearAuthData()` - Centralized function to clear all auth data
- `getCurrentUser()` - Gets current user with validation

### 2. Improved ProtectedRoute (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- Refactored to use new utility functions
- Much cleaner and more maintainable code
- Proper error handling and token validation

### 3. Enhanced API Interceptors (`src/api.js`)
- Added token format validation before sending requests
- Improved response interceptor to handle 401/403 errors
- Centralized auth data cleanup

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
- Multi-layer validation (format → base64 → JSON → expiration)
- Graceful degradation when tokens are corrupted
- Automatic cleanup of invalid tokens
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Complete refactor with utility functions
2. `src/api.js` - Enhanced request/response interceptors
3. `src/utils.js` - New token validation utilities

## Testing
- All files pass syntax validation
- HMR is working correctly
- Token parsing errors should now be handled gracefully
- Invalid tokens are automatically cleared from localStorage

## Benefits
1. **Robustness**: Application won't crash on corrupted tokens
2. **User Experience**: Automatic redirect to login for invalid auth state
3. **Debugging**: Better error messages and logging
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized token handling logic
5. **Security**: Proper cleanup of invalid authentication data

## Prevention
The new implementation prevents similar issues by:
- Validating tokens before attempting to decode them
- Using try-catch blocks around all token operations
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for error scenarios
- Centralizing token management logic
